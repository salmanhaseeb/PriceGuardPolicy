  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  
  <p><strong>PriceGuard</strong> PriceGuard provides functionality that displays products with a price of zero on your Shopify admin panel and allows users to set their state to draft. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our App.</p>
  
  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>We do not collect, store, or process any personal or customer data. The App only interacts with product data available on your Shopify store. This interaction is limited to products marked with a price of zero, allowing you to manage their state by setting them as draft if needed.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We use Shopify's APIs to provide our services, but we do not store or transmit any personal or customer data. All data interactions happen within your Shopify store.</p>

  <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
  <p>Our App does not use any cookies, tracking technologies, or analytics tools.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. If changes are made, the updated Privacy Policy will be posted on this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed of any changes.</p>
